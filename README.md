3. Expo CLI: Install globally using npm by running the following command in your terminal/command prompt:
npm install -g expo-cli
Git (optional): Download and install from the official Git website if you wish to clone the repository using Git.

## Getting Started
* Clone the repository: Clone the repository to your local machine using one of the following methods:
Using Git:

git clone https://github.com/BruhItsShaq/MobileFitnessTracker2.git

* Downloading the ZIP file: Click on the green "Code" button on the repository's GitHub page and select "Download ZIP". Once downloaded, extract the contents to a folder of your choice.

* Install dependencies: Run the following command in the terminal/command prompt to install the required dependencies: 'yarn install'

* Start the development server: Run the following command in the project directory to start the Expo development server: 'yarn web'

This will open a new tab in your web browser displaying the Expo developer tools.

## Running the app on your device: 
To run the app on your mobile device, follow these steps:
  * Install the Expo Go app on your Android or iOS device.
  * Scan the QR code displayed in the Expo developer tools in your web browser using your device's camera or a QR code scanner app.
  * Once scanned, the Expo Go app will open, and the Mobile Fitness Tracker app will begin to load. It may take a few moments for the app to fully load and appear on your device.

## Additional Notes
The app has been developed and tested using the command 'yarn web' to run the project in a web browser, and by inspecting the app in the browser with the Pixel 3 device dimensions. 
To replicate the same testing environment, you can use the same command and inspect the app using the same device dimensions.
If you encounter any issues during the setup process, please ensure that you have the required software installed.
